    <h1>3 Ways to Memorise Concepts Immediately</h1>
    <p>Want to remember concepts but they are long and daunting? Here's a step-by-step guide to
        memorise them now.</p>
    <h2>1. Using Acronyms</h2>
    <p>Acronyms are made by taking the first letter from a few words and putting them together to form a phrase or
        sentence.For example, USA is a acronym. Taking the intial letter of United States (of) America, U-S-A is formed.
        <br>
        Acronyms make it easier for us to remember long words, and we can apply it to our studies as well. Instead of
        blindly repeating: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplcation, Divison, Addition, Subraction (An order of
        calcultion) which does not have any pattern or attributes that makes it easier to remember,
        we can try to remember: <b>PEMDAS</b>.
